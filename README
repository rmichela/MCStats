MCStats is a statistics plugin for the hey0 Minecraft server environment. MCStats
periodically generates xml, json, js, and html files containing server statistics. Optionally,
MCStats can also serve these files using an embedded web server.

Using the embedded web server, the html stats report can be served directly from your
Minecraft server. No need for messy apache installs.

To use MCStats, place MCStats.jar in the hey0 plugin directory and add it to the
server.properties file.

When first run, MCStats will create the MCStats.txt config file and a statscache
file. Statscache is the default repository for server statistics. Deleting this
file will reset all statistics.

The following items can be configured in the MCStats.txt config file.
* statsCacheFile        - The name of the peristent stats storage file.

* webserverEnabled      - Enables or dissables the embedded web server.

* statsBaseResource     - The file name (minus extension) to use when saving/serving
                          stats files.

* resourceSaveDirectory - The directory to save stats reports into.

* secondsBetweenSaves   - The number of seconds to wait between saving stats reports
                          and the statscache.

* httpServerContextRoot - The path part of the embedded web server's url. Must begin
                          and end with a slash (/). 

                          Example: /foo/bar/ => http://host.com/foo/bar/mcstats.html
                          Note: This property only controls the middle part of the url.
                                Not the file name or the server name.

* httpBacklog           - The number of http requests to queue before dropping
                          requests.

* httpPort              - The port the embedded web server listens on.
