MCStats is a statistics plugin for the hey0 Minecraft server environment. MCStats
periodically generates xml, json, js, and html files containing server statistics. Optionally,
MCStats can also serve these files using an embedded web server.

Using the embedded web server, the html stats report can be served directly from your
Minecraft server. No need for messy apache installs.

To use MCStats, place MCStats.jar in the hey0 plugin directory and add it to the
server.properties file.

When first run, MCStats will create the MCStats.config file and a statscache
file. Statscache is the default repository for server statistics. Deleting this
file will reset all statistics.

To purge an inactive or unwanted player from the statistics cache, add their name to
the playersToPurge attribute in the MCStats.properties file. More than one player name
can be added by separating them by spaces. After saving the properties file, reload
MCStats from the server console to execute the purge. You will be notified that the
players were removed when the module reloads. Once the selected players have been
successfully purged from the statistics cache, the playersToPurge property will be
cleared.

The following items can be configured in the MCStats.config file.

* secondsBetweenSaves   - The number of seconds to wait between saving stats reports
                          and the statscache.

                                refreshing the html report in the browser.

* httpServerContextRoot - The path part of the embedded web server's url. Must begin
                          and end with a slash (/).

                          Note: This property only controls the middle part of the url.
                                Not the file name or the server name.

* httpBacklog           - The number of http requests to queue before dropping
